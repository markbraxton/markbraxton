Hello!

I am pursuing the field of data analytics since it is an interestion of my academic interests of mathematics, statistics, and python.

I am looking to transition into the field of data analytics soon. I have recently enrolled in a graduate certificate program in Applied Data Science by MIT and Great Learning.

In this program, I use Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Recommender Systems, Exploratory Data Analysing, and Statistics to work on projects. I expect to complete the graduate certificate program in April 2022.

Please explore my repositories for sample data science projects and examples of my work.

Pleaes reach out with any questions!

Thanks!

Mark Braxton
